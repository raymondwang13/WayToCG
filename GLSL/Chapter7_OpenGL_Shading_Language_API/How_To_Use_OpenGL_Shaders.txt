To install and use OpenGL shaders, do the following:

1. Create one or more (empty) shader objects with glCreateShader().

2. Provide source code for these shaders with glShaderSource().

3. Compile each of the shaders with glCompileShader().

4. Create a program object with glCreateProgram().

5. Attach all the shader objects to the program object with glAttachShader();

6. Link the program object with glLinkProgram().

7. Install the executable program as part of OpenGL's current state with glUseProgram().

8. If the shaders uses the default uniform block, query the locations of uniform variables with glGetUniformLocation() and then set their values with glUniform().
